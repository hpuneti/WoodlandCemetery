## Updating Records
- Data is pulled directly from this Google spreadsheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TMlB6OfVMGAKSmMoX_FL42b7g6ai8y7C_q0lcAxr-1E/edit?usp=sharing
- The spreadsheet must remain in its current format for the code to work
- Editing the data should automatically update the website
